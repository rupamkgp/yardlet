# Launches a QA Yardlet bundle in the background (`open -g`, and YARDLET_QA_BACKGROUND=1: the app is
# never active, has no Dock icon, menu bar or ⌘Tab entry, and keeps its windows and the browser host's
# past every screen, `QABackground`) with a temporary Yardlet home (CFFIXED_USER_HOME, which Foundation
# honors for ~/.yardlet and Application Support) and the visual fixture, so no real session index,
# draft, or provider runtime is read or started, and the person using the Mac keeps focus. The
# browser keeps the mock keychain even in a Developer ID build, so QA never makes or reads the
# installed app's "Chromium Safe Storage" item.
# Prints the app's PID.
# usage: qa-launch.sh <app bundle> <qa home> <log file> [VAR=value ...] -- [app arguments ...]
